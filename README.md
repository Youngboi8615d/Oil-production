This is a dataset downloaded on kaggle.
The data is all about oil production performance in some countries and what the ends product of the oil is all about.
I used SQL to clean the data by removing some duplicates. And i went further to generate some insight to know what the data is all about. In which to know maybe the 
ends product of the oil production is for consumption pattern, industrial production, net deliveries or storage channelization.
